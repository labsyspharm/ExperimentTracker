# ExperimentTracker

ExperimentTracker is part of the LSP's Laboratory Management Information System
(LIMS) which records sample metadata and experimental design for all multiplexed
tissue imaging experiments. It is closely linked with ReagentTracker which
records rich metadata on all antibody reagents used for imaging and assigns
these reagents unqiue identifiers. Experiment Tracker lets researchers design
multi-cycle antibody panels that capture the biolgical markers of interest for
an experiment while also ensuring the antibodies' fluorescent labels are
compatible with a particular microscope. This methodological planning tool
supports the experimentalist in using the correct reagents at each step and
generates a powerful metadata record. ExperimentTracker also records de-identified clinical
specimen metadata and assigns unique identifiers to each specimen slide, helping to keep
each sample linked unambiguously to imaging, transcriptomic, and metabolomic results.
